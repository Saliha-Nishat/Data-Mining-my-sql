Data mining is the process of discovering patterns, trends, and insights from large datasets using techniques from machine learning, statistics, and database systems. It helps organizations make informed decisions by analyzing data and identifying relationships that are not immediately apparent. The core objective of data mining is to extract useful information from raw data and transform it into a comprehensible structure for further use.

Key aspects of data mining include:

Classification: Assigning items to predefined categories or labels.

Clustering: Grouping similar items without predefined labels.

Association Rule Learning: Identifying relationships between variables in large datasets (e.g., market basket analysis).

Regression: Predicting a continuous value based on input data.

Anomaly Detection: Identifying outliers or unusual patterns that deviate from expected behavior.


Data mining is widely used in various fields such as marketing, healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity to improve decision-making and uncover actionable insights from complex datasets.
